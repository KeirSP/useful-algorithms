//binary search is a way of searching through ORDERED data by determining where the search object is located in the data and using a process of "halving" each time to get there
//e.g for finding number 8 in an array of numbers 1 - 10, start at five, then 7, then 8.
//this is much faster than linear search (going up one by one from the first entry)

//let min = 1 and max = n
//guess the avg of min and max, rounded down
//too low? set min as guessed number +1
//too high? set max as guessed number -1
